This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(quantmod)
library(magrittr)
library(TTR)
#library(devtools)
if (!require("TTR")) {
  install.packages("TTR")
  library(TTR)
}
#if (!require("quantstrat")) {
 # install.packages("quantstrat", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
 # library(quantstrat)
#}
#if (!require("IKTrading")) {
#  if (!require("devtools")) {
#    install.packages("devtools")
#  }
  #library(devtools)
  #install_github("IKTrading", username = "IlyaKipnis")
  #library(IKTrading)
#}
library(quantmod)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# the start date, and the date on the right-hand side is the end date. If
# either is left blank, either the earliest date or latest date in the
# series is used (as appropriate). This method can be used for any xts
# object, say, ATVI
